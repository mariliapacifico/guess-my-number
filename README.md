<h2>Guess My Number!</h2>

<hr />

<p>
  This is a game developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript in "The Complete
  JavaScript Course" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
</p>

<p>
  In this game there's a random number between 1 and 20 to be discovered. The
  user can input their guesses in the field and see where it goes ðŸ˜ƒ
</p>

<p>
  This project was my first experience with DOM Manipulation, it gave me a great
  oportunity to work with it.
